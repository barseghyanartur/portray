Changelog
=========
## 1.3.2 - (not yet released)
- Fixed [Issue 43](https://github.com/timothycrosley/portray/issues/43) - Tolerate failures in `packages` of the `setup.py`. 

## 1.3.1 - September 22 2019
- Fixed [Issue 43](https://github.com/timothycrosley/portray/issues/43) - Automatically remap `-` to `_` when attempting to auto-determine module name.
- Added `extra_markdown_extensions` config option, to enable adding markdown extensions without having to redefine default set included by portray.

## 1.3.0 - September 15 2019
- Potentially backward compatibility breaking performance optimization: portray now only renders root project files + the specified documentation directory + any specified extra_dirs.
  If a previously utilized file used to be auto included, but is no longer, you can force its inclusion by adding its directory to `extra_dirs.`
  For many projects, this change results in a significantly smaller output size and significantly faster documentation generation.
- Implemented [Issue 31](https://github.com/timothycrosley/portray/issues/31) - Improved repository auto-discovery and formatting.
- Fixed [Issue 33](https://github.com/timothycrosley/portray/issues/33) - Improving usability and documentation of nav customization.
- Added many additional test cases - Reaching 100% test coverage.
- Added indicators that let users know what step is occurring during documentation generation.

## 1.2.4 - September 5 2019
- Fixed [Issue 23](https://github.com/timothycrosley/portray/issues/23) - A confirmed regression from moving to `pdocs` that caused root modules to not be auto included.

## 1.2.3 - September 4 2019
- Fixed a bug specifying the output dir for `as_html` command from the command line.
- Updated to use Python3.6+ style variable annotations.

## 1.2.2 - September 4 2019
- Fixed a bug specifying modules from command line when no configuration file is present.

## 1.2.1 - September 3 2019
- General improvements to reference code documentation rendering

## 1.2.0 - September 3 2019
Potentially breaking dependency change release from pdoc3 to [pdocs](https://timothycrosley.github.io/pdocs/).

### Migration guide:

- `pyproject.toml` config section changes from `[tool.portray.pdoc3]` to `[tool.portray.pdocs]`
- Type annotations are no longer toggleable but are rather always on.
